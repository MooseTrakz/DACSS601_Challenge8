## The last movie I watched in theaters was Elemental.

My lunch today was awesome! I was able to take part in the staff appreciation lunch put on by campus dining. I ate at the worcestor dc. I don't know the name of the food I ate but I was able to eat food I wouldn't normally have the opportunity to try.
